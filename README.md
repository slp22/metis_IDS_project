## What is the question you hope to answer? ##
How has employer-sponsored health insurance coverage decreased the uninsured rates in various states?    
How has Medicare expansion decreased the uninsured rates in the states that expanded?
Can we predict the next five years of nationwide health insurance coverage based on this data set? 

## What data are you planning to use to answer that question? ##

## What do you know about the data you're using so far? ##
The data is organized by state and includes different types of insurance, from public to private (employer-sponsored, health marketplace, Medicare, and Medicaid). 

## Why did you choose this topic? ##
I currently work in public health, where we often see health insurance coverage is a barrier to people seeking health care for preventive reasons. I'm interested to see the short-term effects of the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010.
